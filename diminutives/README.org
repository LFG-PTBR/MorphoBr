This directory contains new word-parse pairs automatically created by
applying word-formation rules to existing DELAF-PB entries.  These
rules were formalized in the paradigm of finite-state morphology using
XFST, a free proprietary finite-state package (Beesley and Karttunen
2003). XFST transducers in binary format can be used for morphological
analysis in the context of syntactic parsing with XLE.  The source
code of the rules, which will soon be made available, can be compiled
into a finite-state transducer with XFST as well as with [[https://fomafst.github.io][Foma]], a
free/open source finite-state package (Hulden 2009). The word-parse
pairs were generated with Foma, since the non-commercial version of
XFST doesn't allow generation from very large automata.
