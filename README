MorphoBr â€“ resources for morphological analysis of Portuguese https://github.com/LFG-PTBR/MorphoBr

Authors: Leonel F. de Alencar leonel.de.alencar@ufc.br, Alexandre Rademaker, Bruno Cuconato

License: see the licenses of the resources used

Unless otherwise stated, the present resources are directly derived from the dictionaries of the Unitex-PB project:

http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/nilc/projects/unitex-pb/web/dicionarios.html

The tagset used in the above project was converted to a more mnemonical one that generally follows the notational conventions of the descriptive linguistic literature and computational morphology, see tag_mapping.txt file.

In order to use MorphoBr resources for morphological analysis in XFST, or in XLE in the context of syntactic parsing (e.g. with BrGram), they must be compiled into finite-state transducers. Python modules and XFST and bash scripts for performing this task will be made available in the tools folder.
