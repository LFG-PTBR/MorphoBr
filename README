Unless otherwise stated, the present resources are derived from the dictionaries of the Unitex-PB project:

http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/nilc/projects/unitex-pb/web/dicionarios.html

The tagset used in the above project was converted to a more mnemonical one which generally follows the notational conventions of the descriptive linguistic and finite-state morphology literatures, see tag_mapping.txt file. 

In order to use MorphoBr resources for morphological analysis in XFST, or in XLE in the context of syntactic parsing (e.g. with BrGram), they must be compiled into finite-state transducers. Python modules as well as XFST and bash scripts for performing this task will be made available in the /tools folder. Inadequacies and errors found in the Unitex-PB dictionaries were corrected using these tools. See the respective incode documentation for a detailed description of the changes made to the source entries.
