# coverage.py generates a list of files that Freeling recognizes.

It accepts as input a dictionary file and an acceptable list of POS
tags initials as supported by Freeling. Example:

python3 coverage.py FILE AN

Means checking the coverage of FILE against all Freeling, restrincting
to the POS tags that begin with either "A" or "N"

Output a TSV with the following column definition:

First column: wordform/lemma in MorphoBr
Second column: status flag:

       IN-DICT - wordform recognized direclty in Freeling's dictionary
                with the correct POS

       IN-RULES - wordform recognized indirectly via Freeling's rules
                with the correct POS

       MISSING - wordform not known to Freeling with the given POS

Second column: category of POS tag from Freeling (its first letter)
Third column: lemma obtained from Freeling
Fourth column: whether the word was found in Freeling's dictionary

See https://talp-upc.gitbooks.io/freeling-4-0-user-manual/content/tagsets/tagset-pt.html for the Freeling POS tagset for Portuguese.

# add-lemmas: updates the lemma field of a CoNLL-U with the lemmas
  from MorphoBr, as long as there is only one possible value for the
  wordform-POS tag pair.

It also generates file for computing statistics indicating with there
was only one option for lemma (single XX), multiple options
(multiple), and no lemma (missing).

In case there was only one option for lemma AND if the CoNLL-U already
has a lemma, then we indicate whether our suggested lemma is the same
as the one in the file (single eq), or different (single ne).
