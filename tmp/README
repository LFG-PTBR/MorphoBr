# coverage.py generates a list of files that Freeling recognizes in the following format (TSV):

First column: wordform/lemma in MorphoBr
Second column: if the wordform exists directly in Freeling dictionary
Third column: lemma obtained from Freeling

If second column is False but the third column contains a lemma, then Freelings suffix rules were use to deduct the proper lemma.
# add-lemmas: updates the lemma field of a CoNLL-U with the lemmas from MorphoBr, as long as there is only one possible value for the wordform-POS tag pair.

It also generates file for computing statistics indicating with there was only one option for lemma (single XX), multiple options (multiple), and no lemma (missing).

In case there was only one option for lemma AND if the CoNLL-U already has a lemma, then we indicate whether our suggested lemma is the same as the one in the file (single eq), or different (single ne).
