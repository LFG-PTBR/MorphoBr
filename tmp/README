coverage.py generates a list of files that Freeling recognizes in the following format (TSV):

First column: wordform/lemma in MorphoBr
Second column: if the wordform exists directly in Freeling dictionary
Third column: lemma obtained from Freeling

If second column is False but the third column contains lemma, then Freelings suffix rules were use to deduct the proper lemma.
