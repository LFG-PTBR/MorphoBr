#+TITLE: Clitic pronoun tagset
#+AUTHOR: Leonel F. de Alencar

The entries in this directory contain verb forms conjoined with
pronouns in enclisis or mesoclisis. This document explains the tags
used for describing clitic pronouns in Portuguese.

In the DELAF-PB dictionary, such clitics receive the tag =PRO=, which
does not specify type, case, gender, and number of the pronoun. These
informations are important for e.g. syntactic parsing with the XLE/LFG
grammar. Therefore, =PRO= was substituted for the tags explained here,
which specify these features. Alongside these changes, incorrect
formating in many entries was corrected. These errors involve a
spurious colon appended to the word form,
e.g. /mantinhas:,manter.V:I2s/ and /abstinhas:-lhe,abster.V+PRO:I2s/.

| tag  | meaning                                           | type    |
|------+---------------------------------------------------+---------|
| ACC  | accusative                                        | case    |
| DAT  | dative                                            | case    |
| AD   | accusative or dative                              | case    |
| REFL | reflexive pronoun (3rd person singular or plurar) | pronoun |

* notes
- =c X/Y= :: "clitic c is ambiguous between X and Y readings"
- the other tags are explained in =tag-map.org=
- Note that a feature is not specified when it is not explicitly
  marked, e.g. "lhe", "me", etc. are not marked for gender. In this
  respect, compare these forms, for example, with "a" and "o".
