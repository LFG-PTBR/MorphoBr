# This document explains the tags used for describing clitic pronouns in Portuguese.
# These tags are used in the entries in the clitics/ subfolder, which contains verb forms
# conjoined with pronouns in enclisis or mesoclisis.
# In the DELAF-PB dictionary, such clitics receive the tag PRO, which do not specify
# type, case, gender,and number of the pronoun. These informations are important for e.g.
# syntactic parsing with the XLE/LFG grammar. Therefore, PRO was substituted for the
# tags explained here, which specify these features.

# ACC accusative case
# DAT dative case
# AD accusative or dative case
# REFL reflexive pronoun (3rd. person singular or plural)
# c X/Y reads "clitic c is ambiguous between X and Y readings"
# the other tags are explained in tag_mapping.txt
# Note that a feature is not specified when it is not explicitly marked,
# e.g. "lhe", "me", etc. are not marked for gender. In this respect, 
# compare these forms, for example, with "a" and "o".
