#+Title: translating between morphology dictionary formats

this GF grammar can convert from the DELAF and EAGLES-like formats to
MorphoBr's format.

* preprocessing
the raw files from the Freeling and DELAF project contain errors
and/or inconsistencies that must be resolved before conversion.

- DELAF :: see issues #43, #44
- Freeling :: see issues #26

* prerequisites
you need Docker or GF installed.

* conversion
to translate classes from the a format to MorphoBR you can either run
the Docker image and use the [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/][docker cp]] command to obtain the files.

** EAGLES-like -> MorphoBR
- make sure you have the files from [[https://github.com/TALP-UPC/FreeLing/tree/master/data/pt/dictionary/entries][Freeling's Portuguese data]] in this
  directory
- run:
  : sh translate-all.sh

only nouns, simple verbs, adjectives, and adverbs work for now.

** DELAF -> MorphoBr
separate class =x= (where =x= is one of nouns, adjectives, adverbs and
verbs) in a file named =x.delaf=, then run
: gf--run < translate-x.delaf.gfs
and the output file =x.bra= will result.

* WARNING
do note that although you *can* use this grammar to convert from
MorphoBr to the other formats (there'll be some output, with no
errors), the conversion will be wrong in the EAGLES-like format case,
because GF can't use context awareness to make a female and a male
entry become a common-gender entry. neither this or the
DELAF->MorphoBr conversion has been tried, because we had no use for
them.
