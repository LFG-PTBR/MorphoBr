#+Title: translating between morphology dictionary formats

to translate classes from the Freeling/EAGLES format to MorphoBR's you
can either run the Docker image and use the [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/][docker cp]] command to
obtain the files, or:

- install GF
- make sure you have the files from [[https://github.com/TALP-UPC/FreeLing/tree/master/data/pt/dictionary/entries][Freeling's Portuguese data]] in this
  directory
- run:
  : sh translate-all.sh

only nouns, simple verbs, adjectives, and adverbs work for now.
