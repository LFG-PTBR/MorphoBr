# Implementation of diminutive formation in Portuguese in the paradigm 
# of finite-state morphology (Beesley & Karttunen 2003)

# Script for compiling a finite-state transducer modeling
# orthographic and morphophonological alternation rules
# in Portuguese, e.g "manga" => "manguinha" (diminutive of 'mango'),
# "rapazes" => "rapazezinhos" (diminutive of 'boy' in plural)

# This script runs in both Foma and XFST. It compiles a cascade
# of finite-state transducers modeling different alternation rules
# in Portuguese. Most of these rules apply to other derivational
# processes in Portuguese. The individual transducers are composed 
# into a single transducer encoding all alternation rules.

# Defining a marker for words with stemms ending in s, 
# e.g. "lápis", "burguês", etc. In these words,
# z of -zinho suffix is deleted after a stemm's s,
# e. g. "lapisinho", "burguesinhos". In other cases,
# the suffix form is preserved, e.g. "burguesezinhos".
# This marker is just an implementational device which
# distinguishes this word type from superficially similar cases 
# where a final s represents the plural morpheme. 
# Differently than a stemm's s, a plural s is deleted when the zinho
# suffix is attached, e.g. "rapazes" => "rapazezinhos".

# (Villalva & Silvestre 2014:120), and mulherinha (diminutive of woman), 
# which is used by some speakers of Brazilian Portuguese. These forms
# can be generated by changing the left context of the RealizeDim rule.
