#+TITLE: translating between morphology dictionary formats

to translate classes from the Freeling/EAGLES format to MorphoBR's:
- make sure you have the files from [[https://github.com/TALP-UPC/FreeLing/tree/master/data/pt/dictionary/entries][Freeling's Portuguese data]] in the
  root directory, and run
  : sh translate-all.sh
only nouns and simple verbs work for now.
