This folder contains finite-state grammars, scripts, and lexical material for compliling unweighted finite-state transducers (FSTs) modeling Portuguese derivational morphology, using the free software/open source finite-state packages Foma (Hulden 2009) and its proprietary counterpart XFST (Beesley & Karttunen 2003), freely available for non-commercial purposes. The focus is the formation of diminutives, augmentatives, and superlatives (so called evaluative suffixes, according to Villalva & Silvestre 2014, among others). The lexical material contains word-lemma pairs in the space-text format, which can be directly compiled into FSTs. These word-lemma pairs were extracted from DELAF-PB and FreeLing and converted to spaced-text using the Python module in the tools folder. 
This implementation of derivational morphology is work in progress. Beginning with the diminutives, we will progressively include the other suffixes.
It is assumed some familiarity with the paradigm of finite-state morphology to understand the source files and eventually customize them to exclude or include some derivations to suit a particular dialect of Portuguese. For a birds-eye view on Foma basics, see, for example, the first part of the following tutorial, which deals with unweighted finite-state transducers:

Foma is concisely described in this paper:

http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~mhulden/hulden_foma_2009.pdf

Since Foma is practically a clone of XFST, they share the same formalism (with minor exceptions) and virtually all  commands. For an in-depth understanding of finite-state morphology and XFST, see:

Beesley, K. R., Karttunen, L.: Finite State Morphology. CSLI, Stanford (2003).

To compile the FST with Foma and XFST, run the bash script

BuildTestTransducers.sh

The FST is applied in both directions (i.e. generation and analysis) to two test files.
To load the compiled FST binary in Foma and test it interactively, run the following
commands:

foma -e "load suff02-foma.fst" 

and then in the Foma shell:

foma[1]: up manguinhas
manga+N+DIM+F+PL
foma[1]: down elefante+N+DIM+M+SG
elefantezinho
elefantinho
foma[1]: 

The corresponding commands in XFST are the same, only the binary file name is different:

xfst -e "load suff02-xfst.fst"
